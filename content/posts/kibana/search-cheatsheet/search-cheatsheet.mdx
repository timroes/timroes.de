This article is a cheatsheet about searching in Kibana. You can find a more detailed
explanation about searching in Kibana in [this blog post](/elasticsearch-kibana-queries-in-depth-tutorial).

## KQL or Lucene

**KQL** (Kibana Query Language) is a query language available in Kibana, that will be handled by Kibana and
converted into Elasticsearch Query DSL. **Lucene** is a query language directly handled by Elasticsearch.
In nearly all places in Kibana, where you can provide a query you can see which one is used
by the label on the right of the search box. Clicking on it allows you to disable KQL and switch to Lucene.

<Columns>

**KQL**

* Supports auto completion of fields and values
* Supports searching on _scripted fields_
* Supports wildcard on field names
* Supports querying for _nested fields_
* Simpler syntax for some operators
* More resilient in where you can use spaces (see below)

------------

**Lucene**

* Supports regular expressions
* Supports fuzzy search
* Supports boosting

</Columns>

**Which one should you use?** Start with KQL -- which is also the default in recent Kibana
versions -- and just fall back to Lucene if you need specific features not available in KQL.

<Infobox type="warn" title="Spaces in queries">

Lucene is rather sensitive to where spaces in the query can be, e.g. (using `␣` here to represent
a space) `user:eva`, `user␣:␣eva` and `user␣:eva` are all equivalent, while `price:>42` and `price:>␣42`
are actually searching for different documents. Thus when using Lucene, I'd always recommend to not put
any spaces around the operators to be safe. KQL is more resilient to spaces and it doesn't matter where
around the operator you'll put spaces.

</Infobox>

## Finding values

<KibanaQuery
  kql={`dark light`}
  lucene={`dark light`}
>

Find documents where **any field matches any of the words/terms** listed. The term must appear
as it is in the document, e.g. this query won't match documents containing the word "darker".
Read the [detailed search post](/elasticsearch-kibana-queries-in-depth-tutorial) for more details into
how fields will be _analyzed_.

</KibanaQuery>

<KibanaQuery
  kql={`
    orange and (dark or light)
    ℹ️ Use quotes to search for the word "and"/"or"
    "and" "or" xor
  `}
  lucene={`
    ⚡ AND/OR must be written uppercase
    orange AND (dark OR light)
  `}
>

Use **and/or and parentheses** to define that multiple terms need to appear. This query would find all
documents that have the term "orange" and either "dark" or "light" (or both) in it.

</KibanaQuery>

<KibanaQuery
  kql={`
    color : orange
    title : our planet or title : dark
  `}
  lucene={`
    color:orange
    ⚡ Spaces need to be escaped
    title:our\\ planet OR title:dark
  `}
>

To **find values only in specific fields** you can put the field name before the value e.g. this query will only
find "orange" in the color field.

</KibanaQuery>

<KibanaQuery
  kql={`
    "our planet"
    title : "our planet"
  `}
  lucene={`
    "our planet"
    ℹ️ No escaping of spaces in phrases
    title:"our planet"
  `}
>

Putting quotes around values makes sure they are found in that specific order (**"match a phrase"**) e.g. if you
want to make sure to only find documents containing "our planet" and not "planet our" you'd need the following query:

</KibanaQuery>

## Wildcards

<KibanaQuery
  kql={`dark*`}
  lucene={`dark*`}
>

You can use the **wildcard `*`** to match just parts of a term/word, e.g. this query will find anything beginning
with "dark" like "darker", "darkest", "darkness", etc.

</KibanaQuery>

<KibanaQuery
  kql={`d*k *les`}
  lucene={`d*k *les`}
>

Wildcards can be used anywhere in a term/word. ⚡ _Using a wildcard in front of a word can be rather slow and resource intensive
for your Elasticsearch -- use with care._

</KibanaQuery>

<KibanaQuery
  kql={`user.address.* : fakestreet`}
  lucene={false}
>

You can use the `*` wildcard also for searching over multiple fields in KQL e.g. this query will search "fakestreet" in all
fields beginning with "user.address.".

</KibanaQuery>

Wildcards cannot be used when searching for "phrases" i.e. ```"our plan*"``` will not retrieve results containing "our planet".

## Comparing values

<KibanaQuery
  kql={`
    price >= 42 and price < 100
    time >= "2020-04-10"
  `}
  lucene={`
    price:>=42 AND price:<100
    ⚡ No quotes around the date in Lucene
    time:>=2020-04-10
  `}
>

**Compare numbers or dates**. Those operators also work on text/keyword fields, but might behave
[not very intuitive](/elasticsearch-kibana-queries-in-depth-tutorial#ranged-queries-on-string-fields)
and thus I'd recommend avoiding usage with text/keyword fields.

</KibanaQuery>

<KibanaQuery
  kql={false}
  lucene={`
    price:[4000 TO 5000]
    ℹ️ Excluding sides of the range using curly braces
    price:[4000 TO 5000}
    price:{4000 TO 5000}
    ℹ️ Use a wildcard for having an open sided interval
    price:[4000 TO *]
    price:[* TO 5000]
  `}
>

Lucene supports a special **range operator** to search for a range (besides using comparator operators shown above).

</KibanaQuery>

## Special queries

<KibanaQuery
  kql="destination : *"
  lucene="_exists_:destination"
>

Find documents in which a specific field **exists** (i.e. that does have a non `null` value
for that field).

</KibanaQuery>

<KibanaQuery
  kql="products:{ name:pencil and price > 10 }"
  lucene={false}
>

Querying **nested fields** is only supported in KQL. The syntax is
a bit more complex given the complexity of nested queries. Thus
I'd recommend reading the [official documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/kuery-query.html#_nested_field_queries).

</KibanaQuery>

<KibanaQuery
  kql={46855}
  lucene="mail:/mailbox\.org$/"
>

Lucene has the ability to search for
**[regular expressions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/regexp-syntax.html)**.
⚡ _This can be rather slow and resource intensive for your Elasticsearch -- use with care._

</KibanaQuery>


<KibanaQuery
  kql={54343}
  lucene="user:maria~"
>

**Fuzzy search** allows searching for strings, that are very similar to the given query.

</KibanaQuery>
