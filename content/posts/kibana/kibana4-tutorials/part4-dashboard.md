This is part 4 of the [tutorial series](/kibana-4-tutorial-part-1-introduction) about Kibana 4. In
Kibana 3 dashboards were used to create all graphs on and save queries in
different colors and show tabular view of the data. In Kibana 4 as we've seen in
the previous part of this tutorial, all graphics are visualizations, that are
stored one by another. A dashboard is just a place to put several of these
visualizations and arrange them. This has many advantages, e.g. you can easily
use a visualization on multiple dashboard, without the need to copy code around.
If you edit the visualization it will be changing automatically on every
dashboard you use it. When opening the *Dashboard* tab the first time we will
have an empty dashboard, ready to be arranged with our visualizations.

## Placing visualizations

To add a new visualization press the + button in a circle (the right most
button) beside the query input box. A panel with a list of all your
visualizations will be expanded. You can use the filter on the top to search for
a special one, or just browse through the list until you found one. Let's chose
any of them and click on it, to add it to the dashboard. You will see a box with
that visualization apprearing on the dashboard. You can use the top right corner
of the box to resize the box to the desired size. You can also move around the
box by grabbing it at the title bar. If you want to remove the box again (this
won't delete the visualization itself) just press the small x in the upper right
corner. By hitting the pencil beside the x, you will jump to the visualize
editor for this visualization. Try to place several of your visualizations on
the dashboard and arrange them in a way you like. You will quickly notice, that
some of the visualizations need some space to display their content, and will
just display a warning, when you resize them too small. At the end you can have
a dashboard like the following:

## Placing Searches

Besides adding visualizations, you can also place the tabular output for a
specific filter (i.e. what you saved under *Discover*) to the dashboard. After
clicking the *add* button you can switch to the tab *Searches*. Just select any
search you saved on the *Discover* page and it will be added to the dashboard as
well.

## Saving/Loading dashboards

Once you finished arranging all the visualizations, you can use the save button
on the top right to give the dashboard a name and store it. Same with
visualizations and the discover tab: when you make changes to the dashboard, you
need to press save again to store these changes permanently. You can load
dashboards by pressing the loading button and select the desired dashboard.

## Queries in dashboards

Same as with all other screens, you can use the query language to enter queries
in the top search box. The data for *all* visualizations placed in the dashboard
will be filtered by this query before aggregation. If you have stored a query
with a visualization (as described in the previous tutorial part), *both*
queries will apply. So you can use the dashboard search box to quickly filter
out data you want to aggregate, without destroying any filter logic inside the
visualization. If you change the time interval on your dashboard (on the top
right side) this will of course also apply to every visualization on the
dashboard.

## Sharing Dashboards

Same as in Kibana 3 you can press the share link (beside the *Add
Visualizations*) to get some links that you can share around. There is an embed
html snippet available at the top. If you copy out the link written in the
*src=".."* attribute and share this, your users won't have the option to modify
the dashboard. **This is not a security feature**, since a user can just remove
the *embed* from the URL. But it might be handy, if you want to share links to
people, that should not modify the dashboards by accident.

## Résumé

The basic tutorial series about Kibana 4 ends here. We've seen how to use the
*Discover* view, how to create *visualizations* and how to arrange *dashboards*.
If you liked the tutorial, feel free to share it. If you think there some
information is lacking or find some wrong descriptions, please leave a comment
under the appropriate post. Kibana 4 has more to offer, than what has been
covered in this tutorial. There might be some additional tutorials following on
some more specific features, like *scripted fields* or such.
